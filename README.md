# SOI-App
The SCADA Operations Interface Application (SOI-App) is a desktop application used to operate and monitor the network of irrigation control devices within the [Columbia Basin Project](https://www.usbr.gov/pn/grandcoulee/cbp/index.html). The source code for the software will eventually be posted to this repository but in the meanwhile, the Wiki pages will be developed as the production User Guide for the software.
